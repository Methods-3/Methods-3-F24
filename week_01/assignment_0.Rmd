REMEMBER: This assignment is **NOT** part of your portfolio, but is a prerequisite for doing the portfolio

# Assignment 0 - *GitHub*, *R*, *RStudio*, *Python*, *Conda* and *renv*

The goals of today's assignment are:

1)  create a *Conda* environment that contains the *R* and *Python* packages that we need
2)  set up an *R* project using *RStudio* and *renv*
3)  connect your *GitHub* profile to the *GitHub* classroom such that you can hand in assignments and access course materials

## 1) What is *Conda*?

*Conda* is a package management and environment system.

### What is a package?

(from ChatGPT)

-   *Python*: Packages are collections of Python modules. They are often distributed as .whl or .tar.gz files. Examples include *numpy*, *pandas*, and *requests*.\
-   *R*: Packages are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code. They are distributed as .tar.gz files. Examples include *ggplot2*, *dplyr*, and *shiny*.

### Why environments?

We use environments to create **isolated**, **shareable** and **conflict-free spaces** for our projects, e.g. the *methods3_2024* that we are going to create now won't interfere with other projects that we may be running

### Installling *Conda*: miniconda vs. anaconda

*Section can be skipped if you already have miniconda installed*

I recommend installing *Conda* using the **miniconda** distribution. The **anaconda** distribution comes with many pre-installed packages, which may lead to conflicting packages when creating environments.

*Command line install (preferred method)*

**Link**: <https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/#quick-command-line-install>

(If you already have **anaconda** installed, you may prefer keeping it to not create any conflicts )

### Create *method3_2024* environment

```{r engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
cd <path_that_contains methods_environment.yml> # go to folder with methods3_environment.yml file
conda env create -f methods3_environment.yml # create environment
conda activate methods3_2024 # activating your newly created environment
```

### First goal achieved

You are now in an environment that is **isolated** from all *Python* and *R* packages that you may have installed.

The **shareable** *methods3_environment.yml* file contains the recipe for the environment and *Conda* makes sure that the installation is **conflict-free** in terms of dependencies.

**Installed packages**:

```{r engine='bash', comment='', echo=TRUE}
cat methods3_environment.yml
```

## 2) Set up an *R* project using *RStudio*

**IMPORTANT**: Open *RStudio* from your newly created environment

```{r engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
conda activate methods3_2024
rstudio
```

Your terminal or Anaconda prompt should look something like this:

### Creating a new project

Go to File \> New Project; and choose *New Directory* and then *New Project*

Then fill in directory name and put it in a fitting place

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure to save all assignment files in your R-project folder  
**TIP**: use *conda* commands to install new packages, e.g. `conda install -r-ggplot2`  

**Second goal achieved**: *RStudio* now works inside the newly created environment (that is, if you call it from the environment; see Figure 1)

## 3) Connect your \_GitHub account to the \_GitHub Classroom:

The *GitHub Classroom* is where assignments will be shared and where answers to them can be uploaded\
(If you don't have a *GitHub* account sign up at www.github.com)

### Accepting an assignment

Click the shared assignment link: https://classroom.github.com/a/yliHk1EN

The assignments will be handed in the by the study groups that you have been assigned:\
**IMPORTANT**: Create your study group using the appropriate name below: (I do know some of you go by other names, but using the names you are registered by makes it easier to cross-check with the official rosters)

### Doing the assignment

When you have accepted the assignment, you will see the Rmd file with the assignment:

![Figure 4: The assignment repository](images/lala_assignment.png)

![Figure 5: The assignment](images/assignment.png)

You can then *clone* the repository, by clicking the green *code* button and copying the URL

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
git clone <URL to repository>
```

Then provide the solution in the Rmd and knit a pdf

Then add, commit and push to your repository (from your cloned folder)

```{r, engine='bash', eval=FALSE}
git add assignment_0_test.Rmd
git add assignment_0_test.html
git commit -m "solution <group_name>"
git push
```

Now your assignment repository contains the solution, where I (Lau) can access them

The URL's to the six assignments that go into the portfolio will be shared through Brightspace

# Conclusion

**Third goal achieved**: you can now access the portfolio assignments as they are uploaded, and you will be able to upload your answers to your group repositories

**This concludes assignment 0**
